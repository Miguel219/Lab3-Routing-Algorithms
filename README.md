## For Flooding

If you want to write a message you must run it like this:
```
  python main.py -j <JID> -p <Password> -r "flooding"
```
There you will be asked the recipient JID and message, after that you can only listen. 
If you want to write other message, kill the script and run it again
  
If you want to listen, and just listen:
```
  python main.py -j <JID> -p <Password> -r "flooding" -t true
```
